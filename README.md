# AD-Design

Based off the styling of Architectual Digest, this room planner will be an extension of the brand but allow user's to upload the dimensions of a  paticular room or space. From there, using preloaded drawings of tables, chairs, beds, benches, rugs, you name it, users will be able to layout their space to see the way that pieces of furniture fit inside a space. 

This modern and minimal app will serve as a tool for room planning and can be fully customizable based on a user's needs.
